            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Lalampaa Rafting Company was established in the early 2020s with the goal of
                providing safe,
                exciting, and eco-friendly rafting experiences along Kenya's scenic rivers. Built on
                a foundation of
                adventure and community, the company quickly grew from offering small guided trips
                to organizing
                multi-day expeditions and team-building retreats. With a strong emphasis on safety,
                sustainability,
                and local engagement, Lalampaa Rafting has become known for connecting people to
                nature while
                supporting nearby communities. Today, it stands as a symbol of adventure and shared
                joy, where every
                journey down the rapids creates lasting memories.</p>
